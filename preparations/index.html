				<p>
					Astronaut, your mission starts here. Whether you are a professional aerospace engineer or an inexperienced amateaur, our team will prepare you to take the challenge. With our world-class professionals and realistic simulations, you will learn the basics and fly in our program facility to become an Astro-abulstic astronaut!

				<p>
					Training Facility: <strong>Guadalupe Salt Flats, Texas, United States</strong>

				<p>Total time for training: 4 months</p>

				<h2 class="my-8">Practice</h2>
				<p>
					The rockets will go up to space, which does cross over Earth’s
					gravitational pull. Astronauts are trained to move, play with objects,
					and have fun in a micro-gravity Boeing plane. This could help
					astronauts adapt to the new weightlessness environment inside the crew
					capsule during the flight.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Astronauts will practice walking without any buoyancy in swimming pool
					facilities. This would be quintessential when a mechanical problem on
					the crew capsule does arise.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					All AstroTours astronauts must have strong muscles to lift, move,
					bend, and carry objects in space. To maintain muscular strength, all
					astronauts will be required to engage in core activities before and
					during the missions. This will be trained using AstroTour’s air
					bearing floor.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					We have provided 1:1 scale replicas of the crew capsules and the
					rockets so that you and your fellow crewmates can learn about its
					different functionalities and procedures. You will specifically learn
					different emergency procedures, communications with Mission Control
					and more.
				</p>

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Safety</h2>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Human safety remains a large priority to designing our 3 AstroTours
					rockets. Our rockets are programmed autonomously by computers,
					allowing us to continuously test and redesign better capabilities and
					systems that will not cause any severe damage to the crew. Through
					AstroTours’ AstroNet Test Program, we have mobilized the
					rocket-especially the crew capsule- to land safely in case of an
					emergency or a system malfunction.
				</p>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
				
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					At AstroTours, we have created multiple backup escape systems to
					ensure the rockets will land safely back on the launchpad after being
					ejected from the capsule in space. Although a lot of test rockets have
					failed, our team has improvised every one of them and worked towards a
					successful solution to resolve the issue.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Should the rocket detect an unwanted issue in the capsule, all three
					rockets can eject themselves from the booster. The system has been
					tested and implemented thoroughly in the rocket to activate safely in
					any stage of flight.
