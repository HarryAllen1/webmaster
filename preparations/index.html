				<p>Astronaut, your mission starts <i>here</i>.</p>
				<p>
					Whether you're a professional aerospace engineer or an inexperienced
					amateur, our team will prepare you to take on the challenge. Not only
					will you grasp the fundamentals, but you will also embark on a
					thrilling journey to experience the world from a new perspective.
				</p>
				<h2 class="my-8 text-center">Training</h2>

				<p>
					Training Facility:
					<strong>Guadalupe Salt Flats, Texas, United States</strong>
				</p>

				/>
				<p>Total training period: 1 month</p>

				<h4 class="my-8 text-center">Training Routine Options:</h4>
				<ul class="w-full">
					<li>Weekend Sessions, Saturday and Sunday, 8am-6pm</li>
					<li>Weekday Sessions, Monday to Friday, 11am-1pm</li>
					<li>Daily Sessions, Monday to Sunday, 2pm-3:30pm</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="my-8 text-center">Practice</h2>
				<p>
					To prepare our astronauts for the zero-gravity experience they will
					encounter in space, we provide detailed training experiences. Within
					our micro-gravity Boeing plane, astronauts will learn how to navigate
					and interact with objects. This will help the astronauts seamlessly
					adapt to the weightless environment inside their spaceship.
				</p>

				<h3 class="my-8 text-center">Physical Fitness</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Physical strength is a crucial aspect for all AstroTours astronauts.
					Due to the zero-gravity nature of space, astronauts will need to push
					and pull themselves when navigating. To maintain muscular strength,
					all astronauts will be required to engage in strength training before
					their mission. We will provide state-of-the-art facilities, such as
					the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, to facilitate this training.
				</p>

				<h3 class="my-8 text-center">Rocket Functionality</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade-up ">
					We will provide 1:1 scale replicas of the crew capsules and rockets so
					you and your fellow crewmates can learn the different functions and
					procedures. In particular, you will become familiar with the various
					emergency procedures and communications with Mission Control.
				</p>

				<h3 class="my-8 text-center">Safety</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					At AstroTours, the safety of our crew is of utmost importance. Our
					rockets are programmed with the aid of cutting-edge technology,
					allowing us to continuously test and redesign better systems to
					guarantee protection to the crew. Through AstroToursâ€™ AstroNet Test
					Program, we have programmed the rocket, especially the crew capsule,
					to land safely in case of an emergency or a system malfunction.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					We have created multiple backup escape systems to ensure a safe return
					of the rockets. Through multiple trials, significant improvement can
					be seen throughout the iterations of our rockets. So, when you board
					your rocket, you can trust us with your safety and enjoy your
					once-in-a-lifetime experience.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Should the rocket detect an unwanted issue in the capsule, all three
					rockets can eject themselves from the booster. The system has been
					tested and implemented thoroughly in the rocket to activate safely in
					any stage of flight.
