				<p>
					Start your journey here! Before any trip, AstroTours ensures that you will be completely safe and trained for anything that might come your way
				</p>

				<h2 class="my-8">Training</h2>
				<p>
					Our team will prepare you to take the challenge. With our world-class professionals and realistic simulations, you will learn the basics and fly in our program facility to become an Astro-abulistic astronaut!
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Training Facility: Star Site One, Guadalupe Mountains (near the equator)
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Total time for training: 4 months
				</p>

				<h4 class="my-8">Practice</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The rockets will go up to space, which does cross over Earth’s gravitational pull. Astronauts are trained to move, play with objects, and have fun in a micro-gravity Boeing plane. This could help astronauts adapt to the new weightlessness environment inside the crew capsule during the flight.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Astronauts will practice walking without any buoyancy in swimming pool facilities. This would be quintessential when a mechanical problem on the crew capsule does arise.
				</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    All AstroTours astronauts must have strong muscles to lift, move, bend, and carry objects in space. To maintain muscular strength, all astronauts will be required to engage in core activities before and during the missions. This will be trained using AstroTour’s air bearing floor.
                </p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					We have provided 1:1 scale replicas of the crew capsules and the rockets so that you and your fellow crewmates can learn about its different functionalities and procedures. You will specifically learn different emergency procedures, communications with Mission Control and more.
				</p>

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Safety</h2>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Human safety remains a large priority to designing our 3 AstroTours rockets. Our rockets are programmed autonomously by computers, allowing us to continuously test and redesign better capabilities and systems that will not cause any severe damage to the crew. Through AstroTours’ AstroNet Test Program, we have mobilized the rocket-especially the crew capsule- to land safely in case of an emergency or a system malfunction. 
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					At AstroTours, we have created multiple backup escape systems to ensure the rockets will land safely back on the launchpad after being ejected from the capsule in space. Although a lot of test rockets have failed, our team has improvised every one of them and worked towards a successful solution to resolve the issue.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Should the rocket detect an unwanted issue in the capsule, all three rockets can eject themselves from the booster. The system has been tested and implemented thoroughly in the rocket to activate safely in any stage of flight.
				</p>

					These preparations are what help ensure the best quality and experience for our customers
