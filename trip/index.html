				<p>
					Every AstroTour flight requires careful planning and consideration.
				</p>

						<p>
							During launch day, our team will make any final adjustments to
							ensure that you and your crew will have a safe flight. This
							includes proper fitting of the carbon-fiber suit, perfect
							communications with Mission control and a physical check.
							Astronauts will be given a delicious breakfast and a weather
							update on the launch. At T-3 hours, the astronauts will suit up
							and be escorted to the launchpad.
						</p>

						<p>
							Before arriving at the launchpad to meet your rocket, you will be
							able to talk and say goodbye to your family near our base in the
							Guadalupe Mountains.
						</p>

						<p>
							After the astronauts enter the spacecraft and are safely secured
							in their seats, our mission control will go through a rundown of
							pre-launch procedures that were already discussed during the
							training sessions.
						</p>

						<p>
							AstroTours will give a go/no go for launch at T-30 minutes. In
							addition, AstroTours will begin the launch escape system and load
							rocket fuel in all stages of the rocket.
						</p>

						<p>
							Your galactic journey will then begin with a smooth launch from
							our space centers as the rocket ascends towards the skies at an
							extremely high speed.
						</p>

							As the rocket still ascends in the atmosphere, the first stage and
							the second stage boosters burn through until it is extinguished.
							You will be thrilled at the black skies and the blue Earth through
							the window.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+2 minutes, the first stage cuts off and separates from the
							rocket body, which will autonomously and on a landing pad.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+10 minutes, the second stage cuts off from the crew capsule
							and descends back downward to another launchpad on Earth. The crew
							capsule will then orbit around Earth and stay until it is given
							the green light to slingshot to the Moon.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once the mission is given a go for launch by AstroTours Mission
							Control, the rocket will slingshot from Earth’s gravity field
							towards a trajectory to the lunar surface. At this point, you can
							unbuckle your seatbelt and float out of your seat with no gravity.
							The rocket interface system is designed for your enjoyment during
							the trip: windows that encompass breathtaking views of the Earth
							and the Moon, automatic air conditioning (from space) and
							already-prepared delicious space food.
						</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The rocket capsule will orbit around the Moon and release a lander
					vehicle that will take you down to the Moon’s surface. Our services
					have provided the best possible availability for you to enjoy your
					visit to the Moon. For instance, our new state-of-the-art Moon buggy
					is designed for you and your crewmates to comfortably traverse the
					lunar surface!

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Returning</h2>

						<p>
							After your relaxing visit, the capsule will boost and autonomously
							determine a trajectory towards Earth and boost at full speed.
							While you may be exhausted during the buggy ride, our relaxing and
							flexible carbon fiber chairs will soothe your experience back
							home.
						</p>

						<p>
							Prior to recovery, AstroTours will check the splashdown site
							conditions. Our Mission Control team will assign a primary and
							secondary splashdown 2 days before and determine if each site is a
							“Go” or a “No-go”. In addition, AstroTours will evaluate the
							available rescue teams that will drag the astronauts out of the
							crew capsule. The crew must be in liftoff position and embrace the
							heat shields while descending.
						</p>

						<p>
							AstroTours works with the US Coast Guard to establish a zone
							specifically for the rocket to splashdown and to resolve safety
							for other boaters to yield. The splashdown locations are very
							specified, as our team will select an exact date and time for each
							location. Once AstroTours establishes the best location based off
							weather and distance, 3 Kevlar parachutes will deploy and will
							gradually slow the descent speed of the crew capsule.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once the crew capsule splashdowns on the landing site, multiple
							NASA speedboats check the capsule integrity and if there are any
							presence of hazards such as propellant vapors. Other boats will be
							responsible for recovering the rocket’s parachutes.
						</p>

						<p>
							After 10 minutes, the main vessel will move and hoist the capsule
							onto the main deck, and will open the hatch, allowing to retrieve
							the crew. Medical professionals and doctors will be on-hand at the
							deck to assist the crew.
