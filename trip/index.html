						<h2 class="my-8">Launch</h2>
						<p>
							The launch of a rocket is a very highly coordinated process. We
							have the ground team, mission control, and various resources to
							ensure a safe and smooth launch.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our team will make any final adjustments to ensure that you and
							your crew will have a safe flight. This includes proper fitting of
							the carbon-fiber suit, perfect communications with Mission
							control, and a physical check.
						</p>

						<p>
							After the astronauts enter the spacecraft and are safely secured
							in their seats, our mission control will go through a rundown of
							pre-launch procedures to ensure that the rocket will be safe for
							launch.
						</p>

						<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Stage Separation</h2>
						<p>
							As the rocket ascends, the first stage and second stage boosters
							burn through until they are extinguished. You will be thrilled at
							the view of the black skies and the blue Earth through the window.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+2 minutes, the first stage cuts off and separates from the
							rocket body, which will autonomously and on a landing pad.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+10 minutes, the second stage cuts off from the crew capsule
							and descends back to another launchpad on Earth. The crew capsule
							will then orbit around the Earth and stay until it is given the
							green light to slingshot to the Moon.
						</p>
						<h3 class="my-8">Experiencing the <i>delight</i></h3>
						<p>
							Once the mission is given a go for launch by AstroTours Mission
							Control, the rocket will slingshot from the Earth in a trajectory
							towards the lunar surface. At this point, you can unbuckle your
							seatbelt and float out of your seat, experiencing no gravity. The
							rocket interface system is designed for your enjoyment during the
							trip: windows that encompass breathtaking views of the Earth and
							the Moon, automatic air conditioning, and already-prepared
							delicious space food.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The rocket capsule will orbit around the Moon and release a lander
					vehicle that will take you down to the Moon’s surface. Our services
					have provided the optimal conditions for you to enjoy your visit to
					the Moon. For instance, our new state-of-the-art Moon buggy is
					designed for you and your crewmates to comfortably traverse the lunar
					surface!
				</p>

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Returning</h2>

				<div
					data-aos="fade-up"

					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							After your relaxing visit, the capsule will autonomously determine
							a trajectory toward Earth and boost at full speed. While you may
							be exhausted after the buggy ride, our relaxing and flexible
							carbon fiber chairs will soothe your experience back home.
						</p>

						<p>
							Prior to recovery, AstroTours will check the splashdown site
							conditions. Our Mission Control team will assign a primary and
							secondary splashdown the day before and determine if each site is
							a “Go” or a “No-go”. In addition, AstroTours will evaluate the
							available rescue teams that will assist the astronauts out of the
							crew capsule. The crew must be in a liftoff position and embrace
							the heat shields while descending.
						</p>
						<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Recovery Assistance</h2>
						<p>
							AstroTours works with the <strong>US Coast Guard</strong> to
							establish a zone specifically for the rocket to splashdown and to
							resolve safety for other boaters to yield. The splashdown
							locations are very specified, as our team will select an exact
							date and time for each location.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once AstroTours establishes the best location based on the weather
							and distance, 3 Kevlar parachutes, and tight airbags will deploy
							and will gradually slow the descent speed of the crew capsule.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the crew capsule splashdowns on the landing site, multiple
							NASA speedboats check the capsule integrity and if there are any
							presence of hazards such as poisonous vapors.
						</p>

						<p>
							The main vessel will hoist the capsule onto the main deck and open
							the metal hatch once all precautions are met.
