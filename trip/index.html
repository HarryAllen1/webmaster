						<h2 class="my-8">Launch</h2>
						<p>
							The launch of a rocket is a very highly coordinated process. We
							have the ground team, mission control and resources to ensure a
							safe and smooth launch. Our team will ensure that all systems are
							functioning properly as a "go" for launch. The space ship is
							chosen by our team based on the time of the year, pricing plan
							that you chose, and the number you people you have with you.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our team will make any final adjustments to ensure that you and
							your crew will have a safe flight. This includes proper fitting of
							the carbon-fiber suit, perfect communications with Mission control
							and a physical check.
						</p>

						<p>
							After the astronauts enter the spacecraft and are safely secured
							in their seats, our mission control will go through a rundown of
							pre-launch procedures to ensure that the rocket will be safe for
							launch

						<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Stage Separation</h2>
						<p>
							As the rocket still ascends in the atmosphere, the first stage and
							the second stage boosters burn through until it is extinguished.
							You will be thrilled at the black skies and the blue Earth through
							the window.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+2 minutes, the first stage cuts off and separates from the
							rocket body, which will autonomously and on a landing pad.
						</p>

						<p>
							At T+10 minutes, the second stage cuts off from the crew capsule
							and descends back downward to another launchpad on Earth. The crew
							capsule will then orbit around Earth and stay until it is given
							the green light to slingshot to the Moon.
						</p>
						<h3 class="my-8">Experiencing the <i>delight</i></h3>
						<p>
							Once the mission is given a go for launch by AstroTours Mission
							Control, the rocket will slingshot from Earth’s gravity field
							towards a trajectory to the lunar surface. At this point, you can
							unbuckle your seatbelt and float out of your seat with no gravity.
							The rocket interface system is designed for your enjoyment during
							the trip: windows that encompass breathtaking views of the Earth
							and the Moon, automatic air conditioning and already-prepared
							delicious space food.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The rocket capsule will orbit around the Moon and release a lander
					vehicle that will take you down to the Moon’s surface. Our services
					have provided the best possible availability for you to enjoy your
					visit to the Moon. For instance, our new state-of-the-art Moon buggy
					is designed for you and your crewmates to comfortably traverse the
					lunar surface!
				</p>

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Returning</h2>

					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							After your relaxing visit, the capsule will boost and autonomously
							determine a trajectory towards Earth and boost at full speed.
							While you may be exhausted during the buggy ride, our relaxing and
							flexible carbon fiber chairs will soothe your experience back
							home.
						</p>

						<p>
							Prior to recovery, AstroTours will check the splashdown site
							conditions. Our Mission Control team will assign a primary and
							secondary splashdown 2 days before and determine if each site is a
							“Go” or a “No-go”. In addition, AstroTours will evaluate the
							available rescue teams that will drag the astronauts out of the
							crew capsule. The crew must be in liftoff position and embrace the
							heat shields while descending.
						</p>
						<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Recovery Assistance</h2>
						<p>
							AstroTours works with the <strong>US Coast Guard</strong> to
							establish a zone specifically for the rocket to splashdown and to
							resolve safety for other boaters to yield. The splashdown
							locations are very specified, as our team will select an exact
							date and time for each location.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once AstroTours establishes the best location based off weather
							and distance, 3 Kevlar parachutes and tight airbags will deploy
							and will gradually slow the descent speed of the crew capsule.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the crew capsule splashdowns on the landing site, multiple
							NASA speedboats check the capsule integrity and if there are any
							presence of hazards such as propellant vapors.
						</p>

						<p>
							The main vessel will hoist the capsule onto the main deck and open
							the metal hatch once all precautions are met.
