				<p>
					Every AstroTour flight requires careful planning and consideration.
				</p>

				<h2 class="my-8">Launching</h2>
				<p>
					During launch day, our team will make any final adjustments to ensure
					that you and your crew will have a safe flight. This includes proper
					fitting of the carbon-fiber suit, perfect communications with Mission
					control and a physical check. Astronauts will be given a delicious
					breakfast and a weather update on the launch. At T-3 hours, the
					astronauts will suit up and be escorted to the launchpad.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Before arriving at the launchpad to meet your rocket, you will be able
					to talk and say goodbye to your family near our base in the Guadalupe
					Mountains.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					After the astronauts enter the spacecraft and are safely secured in
					their seats, our mission control will go through a rundown of
					pre-launch procedures that were already discussed during the training
					sessions.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					AstroTours will give a go/no go for launch at T-30 minutes. In
					addition, AstroTours will begin the launch escape system and load
					rocket fuel in all stages of the rocket.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Your galactic journey will then begin with a smooth launch from our
					space centers as the rocket ascends towards the skies at an extremely
					high speed.
				</p>

					class="my-4 img-fluid"
				/>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					As the rocket still ascends in the atmosphere, the first stage and the
					second stage boosters burn through until it is extinguished. You will
					be thrilled at the black skies and the blue Earth through the window.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					At T+2 minutes, the first stage cuts off and separates from the rocket
					body, which will autonomously and on a landing pad.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					At T+10 minutes, the second stage cuts off from the crew capsule and
					descends back downward to another launchpad on Earth. The crew capsule
					will then orbit around Earth and stay until it is given the green
					light to slingshot to the Moon.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Once the mission is given a go for launch by AstroTours Mission
					Control, the rocket will slingshot from Earth’s gravity field towards
					a trajectory to the lunar surface. At this point, you can unbuckle
					your seatbelt and float out of your seat with no gravity. The rocket
					interface system is designed for your enjoyment during the trip:
					windows that encompass breathtaking views of the Earth and the Moon,
					automatic air conditioning (from space) and already-prepared delicious
					space food.
				</p>

					src="/assets/images/Altair Lunar Lander.jpg"

					class="my-4 img-fluid"
				/>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The rocket capsule will orbit around the Moon and release a lander
					vehicle that will take you down to the Moon’s surface. Our services
					have provided the best possible availability for you to enjoy your
					visit to the Moon. For instance, our new state-of-the-art Moon buggy
					is designed for you and your crewmates to comfortably traverse the
					lunar surface!
				</p>

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="my-8">Returning</h2>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					After your relaxing visit, the capsule will boost and autonomously
					determine a trajectory towards Earth and boost at full speed. While
					you may be exhausted during the buggy ride, our relaxing and flexible
					carbon fiber chairs will soothe your experience back home.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Prior to recovery, AstroTours will check the splashdown site
					conditions. Our Mission Control team will assign a primary and
					secondary splashdown 2 days before and determine if each site is a
					“Go” or a “No-go”. In addition, AstroTours will evaluate the available
					rescue teams that will drag the astronauts out of the crew capsule.
					The crew must be in liftoff position and embrace the heat shields
					while descending.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					AstroTours works with the US Coast Guard to establish a zone
					specifically for the rocket to splashdown and to resolve safety for
					other boaters to yield. The splashdown locations are very specified,
					as our team will select an exact date and time for each location. Once
					AstroTours establishes the best location based off weather and
					distance, 3 Kevlar parachutes will deploy and will gradually slow the
					descent speed of the crew capsule.
				</p>

					alt="Recovery Parachute"
					class="my-4 img-fluid"
				/>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					Once the crew capsule splashdowns on the landing site, multiple NASA
					speedboats check the capsule integrity and if there are any presence
					of hazards such as propellant vapors. Other boats will be responsible
					for recovering the rocket’s parachutes.
				</p>

				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					After 10 minutes, the main vessel will move and hoist the capsule onto
					the main deck, and will open the hatch, allowing to retrieve the crew.
					Medical professionals and doctors will be on-hand at the deck to
					assist the crew.
				</p>

				<h3 data-aos="fade-up" class="text-center">
					Congratulations! You are now an astronaut!
