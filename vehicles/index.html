					The Andante rocket is a semi-lightweight launch vehicle that provides
					the foundation for space tourism. It can send a maximum of 6
					astronauts to the edge of space. Its lightweight payload, reusable
					rocket boosters and unparalleled power made by our engineers is built
					for the comfort of human space travel.

					The Allegro rocket has successfully created the bridge between Earth
					and the Moon because it carries heavy payload, large rocket boosters
					and uses sustainable biofuel. The rocket boosters enable the rocket to
					free from Earthâ€™s gravitational pull and slingshot to arrive at the
					Moon. The rocket contains heavy payload to carry multiple instruments
					for the lunar mission such as the moon buggy. Its reusable first stage
					makes the rocket competitive in the market, as it could be used for up
					to 30 times.

				<h2>Components of all rockets in detail</h2>

				<h4 data-aos="fade-up">Crew Capsule</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					A pressurized environmentally friendly capsule for 6 people with big
					windows.

				<h4>Ring and grid fins</h4>

				<p>
					Aerodynamically designed to precisely land on Earth without landing in
					a crash.
				</p>

				<h4>Drag wings</h4>

				<p>
					These are deployed to reduce speed and improve perpendicular flight of
					rocket to the ground.
				</p>

				<h4>Biofuel</h4>

				<p>
					All rockets include biofuel engines rather than traditional carbon
					engine in an effort to reduce any negative impacts on the environment.
					In addition, biofuels sustain longer durations than old rockets and
					reach faster speeds of 30, 000 mph to escape Earth's orbit and enter
					the International <i>Karman Line</i>.
