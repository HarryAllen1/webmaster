					The Andante rocket is a semi-lightweight launch vehicle that provides
					the foundation for space tourism. It can send a maximum of 6
					astronauts to the edge of space. Its lightweight payload, reusable
					rocket boosters and unparalleled power made by our engineers is built
					for the comfort of human space travel. The Tempo is a more refined
					version of the Andante but with more engines and boosters to sustain
					one full orbit around the Earth. The Tempo can hold 10 people in
					total.

				<h2 data-aos="fade-up">Allegro: To the Moon and beyond</h2>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					The Allegro rocket has successfully created the bridge between Earth
					and the Moon because it carries heavy payload, large rocket boosters
					and uses sustainable biofuel. The rocket boosters enable the rocket to
					free from Earthâ€™s gravitational pull and slingshot to arrive at the
					Moon. The rocket contains heavy payload to carry multiple instruments
					for the lunar mission such as the moon buggy. Its reusable first stage
					makes the rocket competitive in the market, as it could be used for up
					to 30 times.

						things, not because they are easy, but <b>because they are hard.</b>

				<h4>Ring and grid fins</h4>

					Aerodynamically designed to precisely land on Earth without landing in
					a crash.

				<h4>Drag wings</h4>

				<p>
					These are deployed to reduce speed and improve perpendicular flight of
					rocket to the ground.
				</p>

				<h4>Biofuel Engines</h4>

				<p>
					The ABE-2 (Astro Bio Engine 2) in the Astro launch system will launch
					the rocket with biofuel to prevent any severe impacts on the
					environment. The ABE-2 is automatically capable of reaching immense
					speeds of 7000 mph and slowing to 3 mph.
