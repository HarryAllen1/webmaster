					The Allegro rocket has successfully created the bridge between Earth
					and the Moon due to its heavy payload capacity and large rocket
					boosters. The rocket's heavy payload capacity allows it to carry
					multiple instruments for the lunar mission such as the moon buggy. The
					rocket boosters enable the rocket to overcome the Earthâ€™s
					gravitational field, propelling it to the Moon.

				<h2>Components of rockets in detail</h2>

				<h4 data-aos="fade-up">Crew Capsule</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade-up">
					A pressurized, environmentally friendly capsule for the astronauts
					with grand windows.

				<h4>Ring and grid fins</h4>

				<p>
					Aerodynamically designed to precisely land on Earth without crashing.
				</p>

				<h4>Drag wings</h4>

				<p>
					These are deployed to reduce speed and improve perpendicular flight of
					the rocket.
				</p>

				<h4>Biofuel</h4>

				<p>
					All rockets include biofuel engines rather than traditional engines in
					an effort to reduce negative environmental impacts from the rocket. In
					addition, biofuels sustain longer durations than old rockets and reach
					faster speeds of 30, 000 mph to escape Earth's orbit and enter the
					International <i>Karman Line</i>.
