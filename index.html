				Mario M: I stepped forward to AstroTours initiative with suspicion. I
				was not very knowledgeable about the aerospace tourism industry-I work
				as a city plumber- and other companies have failed my expectations. Yet,
				my experience was one like none other. By 4 months of weekly preparatory
				sessions, we were fully prepared for any emergencies on flight. The
				space mission had me shaken in awe. The capsule crystal-clear windows,
				reclining seats and pleasant dining on the Adante sparked my enjoyment
				as I took sight of the bright, bright stars that surround our planet.

				Mr. Jean: 0 stars. AstroTours has a terrible starship facility. My
				spirits were very high as I came in Star Site One, and I immediately
				smelled the nauseatingly toxic rat smell everywhere in the hangar. A
				middle-sized man apparently named Mr. John with a CEO label noticed that
				I had a ticket on board Allegro. He grumbled at me as he said "Ah, Mr.
				Jean, you are good to go!" "Alright then. Would I stay here for
				training, Mr. John?" He shouted at me while he absconded me "No
				preparation necessary at AstroTours, we just wing everything, and it
				works! Just come back on flight day!" I was immediately shaken as I
				looked at my receipt. My flight would depart in 4 months. After some
				time, I drove back to the same place right before the launch, and a
				security guard came, blocked my car and knocked on the driver's window.
				"Officer, I need to gain access to the hangar because I have a ticket I
				booked for today on the Allegro to the lunar surface." "And your name
				is-" "Mr. Jean!" The officer looked at his phone for a few seconds and
				gave me a puzzled look "Hmm, my database says that your ticket has been
				cancelled due to: 'Missed Weekly Precautionary Sessions prior to
				flight'." I would leave the facility hating Mr. John for the rest of my
				life.
